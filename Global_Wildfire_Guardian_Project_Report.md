### Project Name
Global Wildfire Guardian (GWG) with Mobile Support

### Tagline
Automated Drone Deployment and User-Centric Mobile Solutions for Real-time Wildfire Detection and Mitigation

### The Problem It Solves
The enhanced Global Wildfire Guardian (GWG) serves as an all-inclusive real-time wildfire detection and response system. It employs machine learning models trained on real-time weather data and satellite imagery to predict the likelihood of a wildfire. Upon detecting a high-risk zone, the system autonomously deploys drones for firefighting and rescue missions.

**Mobile App Features:**
1. **User-Centric Guidance**: The mobile app is equipped to help users find safe routes out of wildfire-affected areas.
2. **Agent Support**: Agents can use the app to determine safe and efficient routes for drones to deliver essential supplies like food and water.
3. **Community Connect**: A built-in community feature allows users and agents to share information, tips, and updates.

### Challenges I Ran Into
1. **Data Integration**: Combining real-time data from multiple sources was initially challenging. This was resolved through effective data mapping and model training.
2. **Machine Learning Model Accuracy**: The initial model had room for improvement. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning improved its accuracy.
3. **Realistic Simulation**: Simulating drone behavior and user-agent interaction on the mobile app was a challenge. We used mathematical models and real-world testing to fine-tune the simulation.
4. **Mobile App Development**: Integrating the backend logic with the mobile app while maintaining a user-friendly interface posed a challenge. React Native was used for seamless development across platforms.

### Technologies I Used
Python, Scikit-Learn, Google Earth Engine API, OpenWeatherMap API, FIRMS API, Geemap, Pandas, Requests, React Native
